    !>  A **golden rectangle** â€” that is, a rectangle with an aspect ratio of \f$\phi\f$ â€” may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio.<br>
    !>  The Golden Ratio has been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects and artificial systems such as financial markets, in some cases based on dubious fits to data.<br>
    !>  <b>The Golden Ratio appears in some patterns in nature</b>, including the spiral arrangement of leaves and other parts of vegetation.<br>
    !>  Some 20th-century artists and architects, including Le Corbusier and Salvador DalÃ­, have proportioned their works to approximate the Golden Ratio, believing it to be aesthetically pleasing.<br>

    !>  The scalar `real` constant of kind with highest available precision \RKB representing the **Silver Ratio** constant.
    !>
    !>  \details
    !>  In mathematics, two quantities are in the **Silver Ratio** (or **silver mean**) if the ratio of the smaller of
    !>  those two quantities to the larger quantity is the same as the ratio of the larger quantity to the sum of the smaller quantity and twice the larger quantity.<br>
    !>  This defines the Silver Ratio as an irrational mathematical constant, whose value of one plus the square root of `2` is approximately `2.4142135623`.<br>
    !>  Its name is an allusion to the [Golden Ratio](@ref pm_mathConst::GOLDEN_RATIO).<br>
    !>  Analogously to the way the Golden Ratio is the limiting ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers,
    !>  the Silver Ratio is the limiting ratio of consecutive **Pell numbers**.<br>
    !>  The Silver Ratio is denoted by \f$\delta_S\f$, which can be expressed algebraically as,
    !>  \f{equation}{
    !>      \frac {2a+b}{a} = \frac {a}{b} \equiv \delta _{S} ~,
    !>  \f}
    !>  or equivalently,
    !>  \f{equation}{
    !>      2 +  \frac {b}{a} = {\frac {a}{b}} \equiv \delta _{S} ~.
    !>  \f}
    !>  The Silver Ratio can also be defined by the simple continued fraction \f$[2; 2, 2, 2, ...]\f$,
    !>  \f{equation}{
    !>      2 + {\cfrac{1}{2 + {\cfrac{1}{2 + {\cfrac{1}{2 + \ddots}}}}}} = \delta _{S} ~.
    !>  \f}
    !>  The convergents of this continued fraction are ratios of consecutive **Pell numbers**.<br>
    !>  These fractions provide accurate rational approximations of the Silver Ratio,
    !>  analogous to the approximation of the Golden Ratio by ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers.<br>
    !>  The **Silver Rectangle** is connected to the **regular octagon**.<br>
    !>  If a regular octagon is partitioned into two isosceles trapezoids and a rectangle, then the rectangle is a **Silver Rectangle** with an aspect ratio of \f$1:\delta_S\f$.<br>
    !>  The four sides of the trapezoids are in a ratio of \f$1:1:1:\delta_S\f$.<br>
    !>  If the edge length of a regular octagon is \f$t\f$, then the span of the octagon (the distance between opposite sides) is \f$\delta_{S}t\f$, and the area of the octagon is \f$2\delta_{S}t^2\f$.<br>

    !>  The scalar `real` constant of kind with highest available precision \RKB representing the **Supergolden Ratio** constant.<br>
    !>
    !>  \details
    !>  In mathematics, two quantities are in the superGolden Ratio if the quotient of the larger number divided by the smaller one is equal to
    !>  \f{equation}{
    !>      \psi = {\frac{1 + {\sqrt[{3}]{\frac{29 + 3{\sqrt{93}}}{2}}} + {\sqrt[{3}]{\frac{29 - 3{\sqrt{93}}}{2}}}}{3}} ~,
    !>  \f}
    !>  which is the only real solution to the equation \f$x^{3} = x^{2} + 1\f$.<br>
    !>  It can also be represented using the hyperbolic cosine as,
    !>  \f{equation}{
    !>      \psi = \frac{2}{3} \cosh{\left( \tfrac{\cosh^{-1} \left(\frac{29}{2} \right)}{3} \right)} + \frac {1}{3} ~.
    !>  \f}
    !>  The decimal expansion of this number begins \f$1.465571231876768026656731\ldots\f$,
    !>  and the ratio is commonly represented by the Greek letter \f$\psi\f$.<br>
    !>
    !>  Many of the properties of the Supergolden Ratio are related to those of the [Golden Ratio](@ref pm_mathConst::GOLDEN_RATIO).<br>
    !>  For example, the \f$n\f$th item of the Narayana sequence is the number of ways to tile a \f$1\times n\f$ rectangle with \f$1\times 1\f$ and \f$1\times3\f$ tiles.<br>
    !>  Similarly, the \f$n\f$th term of the Fibonacci sequence is the number of ways to tile a \f$1\times n\f$ rectangle with \f$1\times1\f$ and \f$1\times2\f$ tiles.<br>
    !>  The Supergolden Ratio satisfies \f$\psi -1 = \psi^{-2}\f$, while the Golden Ratio satisfies \f$\phi -1 = \phi^{-1}\f$.<br>
    !>  In the Fibonacci Rabbit Problem, each pair breeds each cycle starting after two cycles, while in the Narayana Cow Problem, each pair breeds each cycle starting after three cycles.<br>
    !>  There is a **Supergolden Rectangle** that has the property that if a square is removed from one side, the remaining rectangle can be divided into two Supergolden Rectangles of opposite orientations.<br>
    !>
    !>  A **Supergolden Rectangle** is a rectangle whose side lengths are in the Supergolden Ratio, i.e.
    !>  the length of the longer side divided by the length of the shorter side is equal to the Supergolden Ratio: \f${\frac{1 + {\sqrt[{3}]{\frac{29 + 3{\sqrt{93}}}{2}}} + {\sqrt[{3}]{\frac{29-3{\sqrt{93}}}{2}}}}{3}}\f$.<br>
    !>  When a square with the same side length as the shorter side of the rectangle is removed from one side of the rectangle, the sides resulting rectangle will be in a \f$\psi^2:1\f$ ratio.<br>
    !>  This rectangle can be divided into rectangles with side-length ratios of \f$\psi:1\f$ and \f$1:\psi\f$, two Supergolden Ratios of perpendicular orientations.<br>
    !>  Their areas will be in a \f$\psi^2:1\f$ ratio.<br>
    !>  In addition, if the line that separates the two Supergolden Rectangles from each other is extended across the rest of the original rectangle
    !>  such that it â€“ along with the side of the square that was removed from the original rectangle â€“ divides the original rectangle into quadrants,
    !>  then the larger Supergolden Rectangle has the same area as the opposite quadrant,
    !>  its diagonal length is the length of the short side of the original rectangle divided by \f$\sqrt{\psi}\f$, the fourth quadrant is also a Supergolden Rectangle,
    !>  and its diagonal length is \f$\sqrt {\psi }\f$ times the length of the short side of the original rectangle.<br>
