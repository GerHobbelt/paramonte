!>  \brief
!>  This module contains the types, classes, and procedures relevant to weights of random samples.
!>
!>  \details
!>  Within the world of statistics, particularly, traditional frequentist statistics,
!>  there is absolute confusion on what types of weights exist and what their implications are.<br>
!>
!>  The most relevant definitions, which are also currently used in the ParaMonte library, are the following,
!>  <ol>
!>      <li>    [Frequency weights](@ref pm_sampleWeight::fweight_type), also known as **frequency**, **count**, or **repeat** weights,
!>              represent the number of duplications of each observation in a sample.<br>
!>              Therefore, the **frequency weights** are expected to be **integers** or **whole numbers**.<br>
!>      <li>    [Reliability weights](@ref pm_sampleWeight::fweight_type) represent a measure of the reliability of each observation in a sample.<br>
!>              Reliability weights are frequently normalized, but not necessarily.<br>
!>  </ol>
!>
!>  There are also other definitions of weight which special use cases, for example:<br>
!>  <ol>
!>              <li>    [Analytic or precision weights](@ref pm_sampleWeight::aweight_type), also known as **analytic weight**, **inverse variance weight**, or **regression weight**,
!>                      are weights that are inversely proportional to the variance of an observation.<br>
!>                      Typically, the observations represent averages and the weights are the number of elements that gave rise to the average.<br>
!>                      These weights are calculated by taking the *inverse of the sampling fraction*. See also<br>
!>                      <ol>
!>                          <li>    [Inverse-variance weighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-variance_weighting).
!>                          <li>    Gatz, Donald F., and Luther Smith (1995), *The standard error of a weighted mean concentrationâ€”I. Bootstrapping vs other methods*.
!>                      </ol>
!>  </ol>
!>
!>  \note
!>  A weighted sample has an **effective sample size (ESS)** that is smaller than the actual number of observations in the sample,
!>  \f{equation}{
!>      \mathrm{ESS} = \frac{ \big( \sum_{i = 1}^{N} w_i \big)^2 }{ \sum_{i = 1}^{N} w_i^2 } ~,
!>  \f}
!>  If the weights \f$w_i\f$ are normalized such that \f$\sum_{i = 1}^{N} w_i = N\f$, then,
!>  \f{equation}{
!>      \mathrm{ESS} = \frac{ N }{ 1 + \mathrm{VAR}(w) } ~,
!>  \f}
!>  where \f$\mathrm{VAR}(w)\f$ represents the variance of the weights.<br>
!>  Therefore, the effective sample size is impacted by both the sample size \f$N\f$ and the amount of variability in weights.<br>
